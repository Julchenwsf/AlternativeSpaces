\chapter{Sprint 2}

\paragraph{} In the second sprint, and our fourth week, of the project the first draft of a product backlog has been created. The main focus of the sprint will be on dividing work efforts both into working with the system development as well as on writing the report. As every other sprint, the group has the goal to be able to display a demo for the customers at the end of the sprint. 

\section{Sprint Plan} \paragraph{} As the first draft of a product backlog’s now created, the group is able to pull a number of items off the product backlog and into the sprint backlog (figure below). As most members are inexperienced in the field of web application development, and had used the previous sprint getting to know the technology better, this was the first Sprint where inexperienced started contributing to the implementation. 

\paragraph{}For cooperative programming simultaneously without causing inconsistency in the project files, the group was introduced to Git and Github by the members with previous experience with the technology.

\paragraph{} From the beginning of the system development the back and front end development have been closely connected. For this reason, it was necessary to make sure every member was aware of how to structure the project files concerning the website. As the technical lead, Valerij briefly went through how a website usually is structurized and how we would adapt this structure to our own project. 

\paragraph{} At this stage, coding is seperated into branches and the code is tested by unit testing. Everyone working on the implementation tests their own code, with the help of others when necessary. Merging branches into the master branch on Github requires that the branches code is fully functional. When merged into the master branch integration testing will be done to make sure that the merge went smoothly and that the code of the master branch runs without errors.

\paragraph{} The group’s goal regarding hours of work per week is 20-25 hours per person. During Sprint 2 the team did not reach their goal when it comes to working. This is further discussed in the group dynamics section a bit below. 

\section{Product Backlog}

\paragraph{} Below is the first version of the product backlog. As we were aware of the major functions required for the project, and had come quite far on developing the system requirement document, the first version of our product backlog was of some use to assign items to the Sprint 2 backlog. Unfortunately, it didn’t take long before we realized that this first version didn’t scale very well with the fast-increasing size of the backlog.

\section{Design and Implementation} 
The design and implementation phase of the second sprint includes several changes in design and implementation focusing on the features regarding signing up, logging in and logging out. 

\paragraph{Design}
%\textbf{Design} \\ 
The design of the sprint includes updates in color, creation of different forms, the header, and on the photo-search page. The theme color of the website was set to a hard orange. Buttons, logo, borders, forms, etc. all inherit the theme color. The backgorund color was set to gray, with a hint of orange. Further designs update the creation of a navigation bar, as a part of the header. The navigation bar includes the logo and icon, also designed in this phase. \\

\end{figure}

\paragraph{} Buttons for signing up, signing in, signin out, and creating an event, were created during this phase for the navigation bar. All buttons are clickable and animated to show a button push. \\

\paragraph{}
Next was the design of the sign in-form and the sign up-form. These are simple forms, that pop up in an overlay window when the corresponding buttons are pushed in the navigation bar. \\

\paragraph{} For the media search page, the media posts were updated to be correctly centered and also enlarged upon mouse hover. See below.

\end{figure}



\paragraph{Implementation}
For the implementation phase of the second sprint, on the back-end, most work complements what was discussed in the design section. We created a signup- and login-form that receives input from users. All information is thereafter validated before sent to the database for user creation or login confirmation. If the input information is not valid, there will be error messages displayed. Also, all buttons and icons refer to the correct forms or pages. 

\section{Testing and Results}
Testing is done during the design and implementation stage. The code is actively functional tested and debugged while code is implemented. The implementation tasks from the sprint backlog are divided into different branches on Github. When each unit is completed, the code is tested before integrated into the git master branch. On merge, integration testing is done to make sure that system, as far as currently developed, is fully functional. Some of the tests include sending valid and invalid inputs to the registration- and sign in-forms, confirming that the information is processed correctly. Lastly, the outputs are checked. \\
On the design implementation side, tests are irrelevant as the implementation is visually confirmed regularly.

\section{Sprint Retrospective} 

\subsection{Start doing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Work more. 
\item Using the now set up Git, Github, IntelliJ technlogy for development of system and report. 
\item Look into the use of YouTrack by Jetbrains for our agile development, to track progress of the project and sprint. 
\item Use the same naming conventions for development items to avoid ambiguity and inconsistency. All names in lowercase. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Backend PHP files: \\ db - PHP folder code that queries SQL. 
\item img - Images resource folder. 
\item js - JavaScript files
\item styles - CSS folder for styling the page items. 
\end{itemize}
\item Set up new branches when starting to work on new functions of the page that are unrelated to the other branches. 
\item Scrum Master needs to focus more on Scrum, sprints and work assignment. \\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stop doing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Average work amount per person too weak.  \\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continue doing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue learning skills for the project.
\item Structurize the folders that have come out of structure. 
\item Use NTNU Home Area, MySQL server over SSH for running and testing code and testing database. \\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Group Dynamics}

\subsection{Customer Feedback}
