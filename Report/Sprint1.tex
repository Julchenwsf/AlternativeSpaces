\section{Sprint 1}
In this sprint, the focus is on learning the tools and languages that are required, finishing the analysis and system requirements, and having a good base for the implementation team to continue work on in sprint 2.

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
The group decided that this sprint would be focused on learning the tools and languages that were needed to complete this project, so that we could shift our focus to implementation in the next sprint. \\
\indent When the sprint is finished, analysis will have been completed, the system requirements will be ready, and we will have a good base to make the next sprint a focused implementation sprint. The implementation for this sprint focuses on adding photo search to the demo, including sorting and tags, and the implementation lead should start thinking about how to split up later tasks.
