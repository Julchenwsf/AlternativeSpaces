\chapter{Introduction}

\paragraph{} An increasingly commercialized public space has made it less possible for urban youth to use it on the same level as others. The aim of the Alternative Spaces project is to give these youths the tools to meet others, act and engage in their local area and connect with other young people from all over the world.
